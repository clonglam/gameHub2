In this project, I would like to create a game Hub by using React and used an API from rawg.io.

# Shorten Project create time

I used chakra-ui, its similar to mui, I can use some of the basic component from the chakra-ui, and need not to build from scratch.

# UI|UX

Loading Skelton and Loading res

# Code quality

To ensure the code quality, I used Eslint, Typescript and prettie.

I found out about Vite and I wanted to have a boilerplate for the technologies that I use. You can find more about these in the following links: [Vite](https://github.com/vitejs/vite), [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [Eslint](https://eslint.org/), [Prettier](https://prettier.io/).

## Installation

Clone the repo and run `yarn install`

or Run command

```
npx degit TheSwordBreaker/vite-reactts-eslint-prettier project-name
```

## Start

After the successfull installation of the packages: `yarn dev`

## Steps in Vscode

#### (works with better with this template)

1. Install Eslint and prettier extension for vs code.
2. Make Sure Both are enabled
3. Make sure all packages are Installed. (Mostly Eslint and prettier in node_modules)
4. Enable formatOnSave of vs code
5. Open a .tsx file and check if the bottom right corners of vs code have Eslint and Prettier with a double tick

If Everything is Good Then It Should Work, but let me new if something else happens
